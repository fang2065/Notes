Best practices for single-cell analysis across modalities

scRNA-seq captures only one layer of the complex regulatory machinery that governs cellular function and signalling. 
To complement this, considerable efforts have been made to measure other modalities at single-cell resolution, 
including chromatin accessibility9, surface proteins10, T cell receptor (TCR)/B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires11 and spatial location12

Filter low-quality cells and correct the noise 
low quality cell (high mitochondrial genes or low gene count); Ambient RNA contamination; Empty droplets and doublets; 
needs to be reassessed during downstream analysis when low-quality cells and doublets cluster together.
setting permissive thresholds initially and potentially removing more cells as necessary during (re-)analysis.


Normalization and variance stabilization
